# Vue VSCode Extension Pack

A collection of extensions for working with Vue Applications in VS Code

These are some of my favorite extensions to make Vue application development easier and fun. 

## Extensions Included

* [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) - Includes support for .vue files, including but not limited to: Syntax-highlighting, Emmet, Linting / Error Checking, Formatting, Auto Completion, Debugging
* [Vue Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-snippets) - These are my own snippets to supercharge Vue application development ðŸš€ 
* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Never worry about formatting your code ever again, keep everything consistent with ease. My suggestion is to add `"editor.tabCompletion": true, "editor.formatOnSave": true,` to your settings file in preferences.
