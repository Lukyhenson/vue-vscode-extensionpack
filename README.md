# Vue VSCode Extension Pack

A collection of extensions for working with Vue Applications in VS Code

These are some of my favorite extensions to make Vue application development easier and fun. 

## Extensions Included

* [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) - Includes support for .vue files, including but not limited to: Syntax-highlighting, Emmet, Linting / Error Checking, Formatting, Auto Completion, Debugging
* [Vue Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-snippets) - These are my own snippets to supercharge Vue application development ðŸš€ 
* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Never worry about formatting your code ever again, keep everything consistent with ease. My suggestion is to add `"editor.tabCompletion": true, "editor.formatOnSave": true,` to your settings file in preferences.
* [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks) - Adds a bookmark to places you designate in your file, and allows you to quickly jump between them. Super helpful. ðŸ”–
* [Jumpy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.vscode-jumpy) - We lose a lot of time scanning with a mouse, time we can get back by using our keyboard instead. Jumpy provides fast cursor movement by giving you a couple of keys that offer a hook to get to another part of the document.
* [NPM Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.npm-intellisense) - a plugin that autocompletes npm modules in import statements
* [ES6 Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets) - quickly spin up ES6 JavaScript with only 3 or 4 characters
* [Copy Relative Path](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexdima.copy-relative-path) - copies the relative path of any file right from the sidebar by right-clicking.
